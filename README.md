# dev-env

My standard MacOS Development Environment: `bash install.sh`

You need to restart before some/all OSX changes take effect

Manual steps needed:
- lastpass
- .kube/config
- Change "Move focus to next window" shortcut to option+tab
- Install adblockers (https://help.getadblock.com/support/solutions/articles/6000055763-how-do-i-install-adblock-how-do-i-uninstall-adblock-)
- setup OneDrive locally (install OneDrive from company portal app, open OneDrive app and enter your maersk email adress)
- add `setenv('GNUTERM','qt')
graphics_toolkit("gnuplot")` to ~/.octave file

Fixes:
- clock should be 24 hour (is AM/PM)
- brew install mssql-tools does not work
- github/bitbucket
- font in terminal
- git clone line in install_shell might not work
